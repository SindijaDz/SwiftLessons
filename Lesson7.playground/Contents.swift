//  Initialization - process of preparing an instance of a class.
//Initializers - good example of a class method. initialize aka create an object.

class Human {
    var name = ""
    var age = 0
    
    init() {}   // This gives opportunity to not write the properties in (name: ..., age: ...)
    
    init(name: String, age: Int) {  // This already mentions that there are properties called name and age)
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
    
}

let person = Human(name: "MM", age: 34)
person.name // This line is not needed if above in () these details are written
person.age // This line is not needed if above in () these details are written

let personTom = Human(name: "Tom", age: 22)
personTom.age
personTom.age = 34  // This adjusted the age from 22 to 34

let personSam = Human() // if init was not written without properties, this line would give an error
